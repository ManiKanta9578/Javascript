// JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. 
// A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:

// For example, 3 + 4 or x * y. This form is called an infix binary operator, because the operator is placed between two operands. 
// All binary operators in JavaScript are infix.

// A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator:

// For example, x++ or ++x. The operator operand form is called a prefix unary operator, and the operand operator form is called a postfix unary operator. ++ and -- are the only postfix operators in JavaScript â€” all other operators, like !, typeof, etc. are prefix.
